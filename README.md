### Code Formatting
This package makes use of [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line-tool), which you can install
from [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 

To apply formatting rules to all files, which you should do before submitting a PR, run from the root of the repository:

```sh
swiftformat .
```
Formatting is validated with the `--strict` flag on every PR
