### Code Formatting
This package makes use of [swift-format](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format), which is built directly into the swift toolchain as of
swift 6. To apply formatting rules to all files, which you should do before submitting a PR, run from the root of the repository:

```sh
swift format --in-place --recursive .
```

Formatting is validated with the `--strict` flag on every PR
